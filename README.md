# Sweepy — /vg/'s Uma Musume Bot (UAT REHASHED)

### A umamusume bot that handles all aspects of gameplay including training, races, events, skill purchasing, and starting runs. 

If anyone has time to kill you can help to verify and screenshot cases where the stat gain detection detects wrongly (emulator resolution) so I can fine-tune the model. The training images I used were quite limited so I'm not 100% sure it works 100% of the time.

## Stat Caps Guide

Stat caps control how the bot prioritizes training based on current stat values.

### Default Configuration
For normal operation, set large values for all stat caps to always select the optimal training:

![Default Stat Caps](docs/statCaps.png)

### Custom Caps for Specific Builds
If a stat maxes out too early (e.g., 1000+ speed before second summer), adjust caps accordingly:

![Speed Cap Example](docs/capSpeed.png)

### How Stat Caps Work
- **Soft Cap**: At 70%, 80%, 90% of target, applies -10%, -20%, -30% score penalty respectively
- **Hard Cap**: At 95% or higher, score becomes 0 (indicates deck optimization needed)

Adjusting your deck composition is recommended over relying on artificial stat caps.

## GPU Acceleration

Optional NVIDIA GPU acceleration for improved performance.

### Prerequisites
1. NVIDIA GPU with current drivers
2. CUDA Toolkit 11.8 ([Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive))
3. cuDNN v8.6.0 for CUDA 11.x ([Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive))

### Installation Steps

1. Extract cuDNN and copy contents to CUDA installation folders:
   ```
   cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.6.0.163_cuda11-archive\bin
   -> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
   ```
   Repeat for all cuDNN folders (bin, include, lib).

2. Add to system PATH:
   - `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin`
   - `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp`
   - `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8`

3. Copy and rename zlib:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Nsight Systems 2022.4.2\host-windows-x64\zlib.dll
   -> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin\zlibwapi.dll
   ```

4. Install GPU version of PaddlePaddle:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall paddlepaddle
   pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==2.6.2 -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
   ```

5. Update `requirements.txt` line 71:
   ```
   paddlepaddle-gpu==2.6.2
   ```

6. Reboot system.
